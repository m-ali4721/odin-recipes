    <h1>Qeema Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/images/qeema.jpg" alt="Lahore Qeema">
    <p>Qeema, a flavorful minced meat dish, is a beloved staple in South Asian cuisine. Traditionally made with ground beef, mutton, or chicken, it is cooked with a medley of aromatic spices, onions, tomatoes, and green chilies. The combination of cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric infuses the meat with rich, warm flavors, making it a comforting and satisfying meal. Whether served with hot naan, paratha, or rice, Qeema offers a savory experience with every bite</p>
    <p>One of the key elements that makes Qeema so delicious is its versatility. It can be enjoyed as a main dish, stuffed into breads, or even used as a filling for samosas or parathas. Some variations of Qeema include peas (matar) or potatoes, adding a delightful texture and contrast to the dish. The beauty of Qeema lies in its simplicity—quick to prepare yet packed with robust flavors that make it a family favorite for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
