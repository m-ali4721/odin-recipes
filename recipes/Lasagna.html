    <h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Desi Lasagna" width="300" height="300">
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers sheets of pasta with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese to create a hearty and comforting meal. The base typically consists of a slow-cooked meat sauce made with ground beef or sausage, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs like oregano and basil. The sauce is layered between wide, flat lasagna noodles, along with béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese, which adds creaminess to balance the bold flavors of the meat and tomato.

    <p>What makes lasagna truly special is its versatility. While the traditional recipe is widely loved, there are countless variations to suit different tastes. From vegetarian versions loaded with spinach and mushrooms to rich alternatives using chicken or seafood, lasagna offers endless possibilities.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, beaten egg (if using), salt, and black pepper. Mix well until smooth.</li>
